# Events-Handler
An Android Application to register event participants to an event so that an accurate count of event participants can be recorded.

A part of our internship projects. The other associated project is [QR Authenticator](https://github.com/Aurum1611/qralpha2) which scans the QR code, queries the database searching for a matching key, and authenticates the user.
